## Part 1 of Final: Soil Sensor Portion

# Task One: Functioning LED Lights

<br /> Task one consisted of a Functioning LED series of lights using the microbit and miniature breadboard. The lights are capable of dimming and cycling between each other.

# Task Two: Enabled Led Matrix

Task two consisted of the LED matrix being enabled on the microbit. I was able to create a code and correctly create the circuit to display its functionality.

# Task Three: Screensaver portion of project

In this step I created code that brings the use of the microbit, circuitry and code together to synchronize the flashing of LED lights with the display of the Microbit.

# Task Four: Digital In- Portion of project

In this portion of the project I was able to apply the use of buttons in lighting an LED from the breadboard. I created code that turns on the LED light when the "A" button is pressed on the Microbit.

# Task Five: Manual Calibration of Soil Sensor

Task five called for manual calibrated the soil sensor to display the readings on the microbit. I was able to do this using a bar system that shows the amount of water read to the amount of bars displayed. [manual-calibration.js](https://github.com/Introduction-to-Computer-Engineering/final-project-assignment-7-week-12-RomanGAnker/blob/master/manual-calibration.js)
<br />

# Task Six: Automatic Calibration of Soil Sensor

In the final step of project seven I was able to create a microbit code that requests the user to take 3 low samples and 3 high samples. After collecting the readings, the microbit then displays the average of the 3 low collection and the 3 high connections using bars.
